Acrust of bread and a corner to sleep in, 
A minute to smile and an hour to weep in, 
A pint of joy to a peck of trouble, 
And never a laugh but the moans come double; 
And that is life!

A crust and a corner that love makes precious, 
With a smile to warm and the tears to refresh us; 
And joy seems sweeter when cares come after, 
And a moan is the finest of foils for laughter; 
And that is life!
